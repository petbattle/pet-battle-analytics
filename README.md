 This repo has two charts for collecting analytics from our site.
 
 1. [Fathom](tree/main/charts/fathom/) - is a lightweight no frills tracking app that can detect time on page and some other usefull drop off metrics
 2. [Matomo](tree/main/charts/matomo/) - is more advanced and can do things akin to Google Analytics including page instrumentation.
